## Getting Started

See installation and user guide documents in the [documentation](./docs) subdirectory.

## Authors

* John Eason

See also the list of [contributors](../../contributors) who participated in this project.

## Development Practices

* Code development will be performed in a forked copy of the repo. Commits will not be 
  made directly to the repo. Developers will submit a pull request that is then merged
  by another team member, if another team member is available.
* Each pull request should contain only related modifications to a feature or bug fix.  
* Sensitive information (secret keys, usernames etc.) and configuration data 
  (e.g. database host port) should not be checked in to the repo.
* A practice of rebasing with the main repo should be used rather than merge commits.
